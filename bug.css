The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if the order of operations is not correctly handled.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely result in an error because `10` lacks a unit. Another issue is incorrect nesting or parentheses in complex calculations.
